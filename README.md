# WallStreetBetsBot
WallStreetBetsBot is a web scraper that utilizes PRAWN and reddit API to scrape WallStreetBets for stock ticketer frequencies and tells you which stock to sell or purchase puts on based on the top frequency. This program should not be used as financial advice and is developed solely for comedic purposes.

# TODO
Once I obtain a twitter developer account I will connect this program to a twitter bot account and have it tweet out its findings everyday. This project is on hold until twitter opens developer functionality to the public.
